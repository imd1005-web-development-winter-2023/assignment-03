## Grading rubric

The creation and posting of this web page is worth 25% of your final grade and marked out of 100.

|Criteria|Total&nbsp;Marks|How we define excellence|
|----|----|----|
|Visual design|**15%**|The design presented demonstrates an excellent use of colour (or lack thereof), typography, high quality graphics, and iconography. The design also comes across as cohesive, inviting, and illustrates a focus on user experience. An excellent design also includes a way of delighting users and adding moments of charm to their experience.|
|Content and layout|**15%**|The content implemented on the web page demonstrates a clear hierarchy and an effective layout is employed for the content that is being displayed in each section. The solution is responsive to the users' viewport and displays well in mobile, tablet, and desktop browsers.|
|HTML|**20%**|The HTML code submitted is well formed, structured, and complaint. Appropriate semantic elements are used throughout the document. For example, use `<header>` for the page header and `<section>` for each document section within `<main>`. Correct use of headings `<h1-h6>` and heading structure. The web page has the appropriate meta tags in the `<head>` to set the charset, viewport and IE11 legacy mode values.|
|CSS|**20%**|The CSS code submitted is well formed, structured, and compliant. A CSS reset file is used to 'reset' all of the default browser styles. The web page renders correctly in multiple browsers, including but not limited to Firefox and / or Chrome. All CSS should be referenced from an external file. The web page should not use a `<style>` tag or a embedded `style` attributes to apply CSS to the page.|
|JavaScript|**20%**|The JS code submitted is well formed, structured, and compliant. No run time errors should occur. If an error occurs it should be caught and dealt with appropriately. Your code should be written to the latest ECMAScript 2022 standard. |
|GitHub&nbsp;submission|**10%**|All of the project files (HTML, CSS, JS, assets) are added to your assignment repository on GitHub. The repository has both a populated READMe.md file and a MIT license file.|

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<dl>

  <dt>What type and style of web page do I have to build?</dt>
  <dd>You can build anything you want that meets the content requirements. If you want to build a portfolio site - go for it! If you want to build the home page of an e-commerce store - that's cool too!</dd>
  
  <dt>Does the web page have to work in both mobile and desktop</dt>
  <dd>No! You may build either a mobile or a desktop version of your web page. You may build a responsive web page if you would like but it is not a requirement for this assignment.</dd>
 
  <dt>Can I use lorem ipsum text in my webpage</dt>
  <dd>You may use lorem ipsum if you need to but for this assignment try to use relevant content. Though, if you don't have relevant content you are absolutely permitted to use <a href="https://www.lipsum.com">lorem ipsum</a>, <a href="https://baconipsum.com">bacon ipsum</a>, or <a href="https://veganipsum.me">vegan ipsum</a> in your designs. Keep in mind that this should not be used in cases where the meaning of the text is important, for example the call to action buttons in the hero.</dd>

  <dt>Do I need to include sketches, concepts, or initial low fidelity mockups in the report</dt>
  <dd>No. If you would like to share your design or creative process I'm happy to look at them, but it is not required.</dd>
 
  <dt>Can I use trademarked or copywritten material on my page?</dt>
  <dd>Yes! As this is for educational purposes, all of the source is open, and no one is trying to sell their design or code you can absolutely use trademarked or copywritten material.</dd>
